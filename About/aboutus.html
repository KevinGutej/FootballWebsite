                The oldest professional football club in the world still in existence today is Sheffield FC.
                Referees were not used in official soccer matches until 1881.The World Cup was designed to showcase the best professional football players in the world.
                Uruguay is the only World Cup champion not to attempt to defend their title four years later.
                Approximately 250 million people play the sport in over 200 countries, which makes it the world’s most popular sport.
                Field players end up running anywhere from 5 to 10 miles during the match. 
                The most expensive transfer in soccer history came when Paris St. Germain paid FC Barcelona $263 million to obtain Neymar Jr.
                The biggest recorded loss in football history was 149-0, and all the own goals were scored in protest.
                The number 10 is unofficially considered the kit number for the best player on a squad.

                Football is the most popular sport in the world. There are more than 265 million players in the world.
                More than 3.5 billion people watch the FIFA World Cup. The FIFA World Cup is the world’s most-watched sports event.
                The Fifa World Cup has been ongoing every fourth year since 1930, and despite 21 tournaments being played since the first one in Uruguay, only 8 different countries have won the tournament.
                Brazil has won the FIFA World Cup 5 times, which makes it the most successful national team of all times. 
                Ronaldo was one of the four men to win the FIFA World Player of the Year award thrice (or more) alongside Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
