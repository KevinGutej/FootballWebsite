                Uruguay is the only World Cup champion not to attempt to defend their title four years later.
                Approximately 250 million people play the sport in over 200 countries, which makes it the world’s most popular sport.
                Field players end up running anywhere from 5 to 10 miles during the match. 
                The most expensive transfer in soccer history came when Paris St. Germain paid FC Barcelona $263 million to obtain Neymar Jr.
                The biggest recorded loss in football history was 149-0, and all the own goals were scored in protest.
