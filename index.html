                    A player can be given a yellow card or red card by the referee if they break any of the rules in the game. This can, for example, be a rough tackle, or saying something inappropriate to the referee.
If a player is given two yellow cards in the same game, they will get a red card and be sent off from the pitch. 
However, the highest attendance ever recorded was at the Maracanã Stadium in 1950 where 199,854 people saw Uruguay vs Brazil. The current attendance is set to 78,838.

                    A professional game is always 90 minutes long divided into two halves of 45 minutes + stoppage time. The stoppage time is usually between 1 to 5 minutes depending on injuries and breaks in each half of the game.
                    Brazil has won the FIFA World Cup 5 times, which makes it the most successful national team of all times. 
                    When an American is talking about football, they’re usually referring to American Football, which is one of the most popular sports in the United States.
                    Some other variations of the sport include futsal, eFootball, and beach football.  </p>
