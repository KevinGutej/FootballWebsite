                    I love chelsea because it is the best soccer team ever and I really like them becuase they wear the blue
                        kit(Thats mine favourite color).I have been supporting this team for a while now and I hope the team stays on track and gets alot of wins.
                        This team has alot of amazing players and has a great hystory.They have won alot of the matches but also lost some.

                    Kante is from France .Kante play center midfeild.It's a position where you need alot of stamina to run around
                    the pitch.I play in this position in my school team.He has worked as a trash picker.Kante grew up in a small flat in Rueil Malmaison, a small and densely populated suburban area to Paris.
                    He decided to be a footballer at the age of 8 After the France 98 world cup, Kante saw a different France, A France of opportunities.</p>

        </h3>
        
        <h3>My 3 favourite players in the whole team are:</h3>
        <h3>Kante:</h3>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3 title="haslo">Thiago Silva:</h3>
        <p>I really like Thiago Silva because he play in center back.I really like people that play in center back
                becuase it a positon where you make it harder for the other team to score.It's a very important role.</p>
        </p>
        <h3 id="id1" class="klasa1">James:</h3>
        <p>My last favourite player is James.He plays Right back.I really like him becuase he will always help the team
                to tackel the oppositians.This is a role where you need to have good thinking,and that's because you need to
                know where the opposite team is gonna run,pass and shoot.</p>
