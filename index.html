    <h3>My 3 favourite players in the whole team are:</h3> 
    
    <h3><i>Kante:</i></h3>
   
    <p><i>Kante is from France .Kante play center midfeild.It's a position where you need alot of stamina to run around the pitch.I play in this position in my school team.</i></p>

    <h3>Thiago Silva:</h3>
    <p><i>I really like Thiago Silva because he play in center back.I really like people that play in center back becuase it a positon where you make it harder for the other team to score.It's a very important role.</i></p>
    <h3>.id""nazwa_id1.class"klasa1">James:</h3>
    <p><i>My last favourite player is James.He plays Right back.I really like him becuase he will always help the team to tackel the oppositians.This is a role where you need to have good thinking,and that's because you need to know where the opposite team is gonna run,pass and shoot.</i></p>
